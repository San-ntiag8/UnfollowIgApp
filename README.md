<h1> UnfollowIgApp </h1>  

<h2> Hi folks! </h2> 

In this repository, you'll find three `.py` files. Below is a brief explanation of each:

### 1. `Base.py`
This file contains the foundational idea of the program, where the core logic is implemented.

### 2. `TestCredentials.py`
Use this file to test the environment variables and ensure everything is set up correctly.

### 3. `UnfollowIgApp.py`
This is the main script you need to run. It will produce two outputs: a `ctype` file with the information and two new JSON files where the data will be stored.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `instaloader`
  - `json`
  - `load_dotenv`
  - `datetime`
  - `os`
  - `ctypes`
  - `time`

## Warnings

- ⚠️ **Caution**: Avoid excessive execution, as Instagram's API may restrict your account if it detects overuse.
